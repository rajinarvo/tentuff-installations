testinghead1: "TENTUFF Tests Done"
testingPara1: "Every TENTUFF Security door stands tough with immense tensile strength to prevent any intruder from breaking into your home. This premium product has undergone multiple rigorous tests to withstand the impact based on several factors. With its advanced technology and security features, TENTUFF is trusted as the best-in-class security door and window system for homes."
testinghead2: "JEMMY TEST / CROW BAR TEST"
testingPara2: "A Jemmy attack is conducted in a simulated environment using a tool similar to a large screw driver against a TENTUFF security door or window. It is an effective way to check the withstanding power of locks and hinges against a specific torque. TENTUFF products are tried and tested to take this impact, without any damage on the hinges and locks. Only after passing the Jemmy test, does a TENTUFF door or window get certified to be suitable for installation at your home."
testinghead3: "KNIFE SHEAR"
testingPara3: "Keeping in mind, the possibility of a knife attack by an intruder, we simulate the situation to test the strength of our products. A knife blade is mechanically controlled to slice and cut the mesh multiple times. Our high grade stainless steel mesh has proven to withstand the knife action without any damage."
testinghead4: "DYNAMIC IMPACT TEST"
testingPara4: "Imagine someone kicking your door with all his might. This is exactly what we simulate using a sand and lead-filled bag. The door is subjected to multiple impacts measured in joules. The test is considered ‘fail’ if the mesh is dislodged. Thanks to the patented ‘Grip lock’ mesh retaining system, TENTUFF doors have passed this test consistently with flying colours."
testinghead5: "SALT SPRAY TEST"
testingPara5: "TENTUFF doors and windows undergo rigorous corrosion-resistant tests to ensure longer durability and solidity. The Salt Spray Test is a reliable way to check corrosion-resistance. The sample product is placed inside a test chamber and exposed to a corrosive atmosphere under controlled conditions for prolonged hours. Resistance to corrosive attacks is used to assess the quality of the sample against the conditions of the test. The success in this test adds to the reliability of TENTUFF products, making them fit to be installed for your security."
