Notice to TENTUFF™ of any alleged defect within a product must include a proof of purchase in order for us to be obliged to respond to the claim. Follow the Guide word for word. You have made an investment by purchasing a high quality product; and you ought not to let it go to waste by not looking after it. Make sure you read through our Guide carefully and follow the cleaning guides as per your geographic location. Failure to do so will result in your warranty being void, and the integrity of your product potentially deteriorating. Not only will maintaining your TENTUFF™ products correctly keep your warranty intact, but it will prolong the lifespan of your TENTUFF™ security products beyond your Warranty Period."
