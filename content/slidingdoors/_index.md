slidingPara: "TENTUFF Sliding Security Doors provide security retrofitted to your existing sliding glass doors. Slide left to right, right to left or walk out in the centre. When kept closed and locked with the 3-point locking system, it keeps thugs and bugs out, but allows the fresh air in and gives you a seamless view of the outdoors."
